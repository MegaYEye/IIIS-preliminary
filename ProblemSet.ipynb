Each path in the graph starting from a distinguished vertex $v_0 \\in V$ corresponds to a possible sequence of sounds produced by the model. We define the label of a directed path to be the concatenation of the labels of the edges on that path.\n",

The sum of the probabilities of the edges leaving any vertex equals 1. The probability of a path is defined to be the product of the probabilities of its edges. We can view the probability of a path beginning at $v_0$ as the probability that a random walk beginning at $v_0$ will follow the specified path, where we randomly choose which edge to take leaving a vertex $u$ according to the probabilities of the available edges leaving $u$. Extend your answer to part 1 so that if a path is returned, it is a most probable path starting at $v_0$ and having label $s$. Analyze the running time of your algorithm."

    "In this problem, we explore an interesting trick to speed up a dynamic program. We use the edit distance problem as an example (See the last problem). We assume the size of the alphabet is constant. Suppose the two strings are $S_1$ and $S_2$, both of length $n$. To start with, your solution for the last problem must run in $O(n^2)$ time. If it is so, in the dynamic program for the problem, you need to fill a two dimensional table $M$. In fact, we can fill out this table in a more clever way such that the running time can be improved to $O(n^2/ \\log n)$ (I know, it is a small improvement and of little practical interests for this particular problem. But the same trick has been used somewhere else to make a huge difference). In this trick, we need to a bit preprocessing to make many small tables. Then we fill only a subset of entries of the dynamic program table. The value of a table entry we are filling depends on the values of some entries we have already filled and the list we made in the beginning.\n",

    "In each round, your protocol can choose a player and let the player to broadcast a bit (depending on your protocol, the bit can be either the player’s own bit, or other encoded information). Upon the broadcast, each other player can receive the bit with probability $1 − \\epsilon$ for some small constant $0 < \\epsilon < 1/3$, and the flipped bit with probability $\\epsilon$ (all flips are independent of each other). Show if every player broadcasts her bits for k = O(log n) times, the coordinator can compute the parity correctly with probability 0.9."

    "题意1：每次广播之后每个人以概率$1-\\epsilon$变成这个被广播的bit，以$\\epsilon$翻转手中的bit。\n",
    "\n",
    "题目还有不太清楚的地方就是，coordinator显然不能知道全局信息，但是每个player能不能知道全局信息呢？如果每个player能知道全局信息，那么它就广播目前大家手里面比较少的bit，比如10101时，就广播0，然后持有1的不管怎么着都变成0，持有0的以概率$1-\\epsilon$保持0。Claim：这些个一样的bit以后都会保持一样，并且bit一样的数目会越来越多。\n",
    "\n",
    "假设每一轮广播之前，更多的比特的持有数目为$x_i$，较少的就为$n-x_i$，广播较少的比特数之后，持有之前较少比特数的期望为$x+(n-x)(1-\\epsilon)$，即$x_{i+1} = x_i+(n-x_i)(1-\\epsilon)$，经过k轮之后大概率大家手上的bit都是一样的了，因此能够计算总宇称。\n",
    "\n",
    "题意二：每个人接收被广播的bit都有$\\epsilon$的概率出错，但是每个人手上的bit是固定不变的\n",
    "\n",
    "那么就要求每个人广播自己的bit 2k+1次，然后coordinator就对每个人广播的bit做majority vote来决定这个人手里面是0还是1，majority vote的胜率是$1-\\Phi(\\dfrac{k - 2k(1-\\epsilon)}{\\sqrt{2k\\epsilon(1-\\epsilon)}})$（Moivre-Laplace-Theorem），最后证明以k=O(log n)就可以大概率得到每个人正确的bit。"
